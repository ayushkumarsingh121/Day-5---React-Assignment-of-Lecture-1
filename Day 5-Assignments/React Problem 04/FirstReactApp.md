This is a basic project using **React** with **Babel** to create a simple subscription form that includes an image, some text, and input fields.

### Key Components:

1. **Image**: 
   - Displays a picture with a width of 300px.
   - The cursor changes to a pointer when you hover over the image.

2. **Header and Message**:
   - A large heading that says "SUBSCRIBE" and a subheading encouraging users to subscribe to the newsletter.
   - Both the heading and subheading change the cursor to a pointer when hovered.

3. **Input Box**:
   - A text field where users can enter their email or information.
   - Styled with rounded corners, light background color, and no border for a clean look.

4. **Button**:
   - A "Subscribe" button styled with a blue background, white text, and rounded corners.
   - The button changes the cursor to a pointer when hovered, indicating it's clickable.

### Styling:
- The layout is centered with a bordered container that has some padding and rounded corners.
- All elements are styled for simplicity, with hover effects to make the form interactive and visually appealing.
